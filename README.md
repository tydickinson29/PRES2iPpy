# PRES2iPpy

This repository is to house subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) extreme precipitation event databases and document the code used in building such databases. This work is being done by the PRES2iP team. Our main goals are to increase our overall understanding of S2S extreme precipitation events, ranging from the definition of such events to the dynamical characteristics on the synoptic and global scales, improve long-lead prediction of these events, and improve communication between the research and stakeholder communities with regard to extreme precipitation.

Any use of the code or databases contained in this repository should reference [Dickinson et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0580.1). The main point of contact for any questions or concerns is Ty Dickinson (ty.dickinson@ou.edu).

## What is PRES2iP?

PRES2iP stands for Prediction of Rainfall Extremes at Subseasonal to Seasonal Periods. The PRES2iP team consists of undergraduates, graduates, and faculty at the University of Oklahoma as well as scientists at the National Severe Storms Laboratory, National Center for Atmospheric Research, the Cooperative Institute of Mesoscale Meteorological Studies, and the OU South Central Climate Adaptation Science Center. The work is supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. ICER-1663840. Check out the team's website [here](http://pres2ip.com) or on Twitter @pres2ip.
