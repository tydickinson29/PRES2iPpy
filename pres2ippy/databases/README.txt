Version History of Databases Created by Ty Dickinson
====================================================

14-day events
-------------
v1.2: Created February 20, 2020. Update to v1.1 by implementing a new postprocessing scheme. This new scheme uses a correlation approach to group events as opposed to intersection between polygons.

v1.1: Created February 7, 2020. Update to v1.0 by utilizing a hybrid approach to outline events given a KDE density field. Discrete contour is either 0.0865 or the local map's 90th percentile, whichever is larger.

v1.0: Created November 15, 2019. Original creation of database testing begin dates from January 1, 1915 through December 31, 2018. Used single contour for KDE density to outline events (0.0865).
